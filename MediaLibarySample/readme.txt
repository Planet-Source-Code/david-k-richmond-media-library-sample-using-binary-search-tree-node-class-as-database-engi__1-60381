' Purpose:
'        This is a beta media library sample using the BSTN class as it's database engine.
'        Other p-s-c visitors offered their help in testing the beta sample, checking the adds, removes,
'        ordered lists etc. and it's overall general usage.
'        The sample maintains details of media such as CDs, DVDs, Audio Tapes, VHS Videos etc.

' OVERVIEW:
' -----------
'
' DEBUGGING:
' ---------
' In BSTN Class Initialise :  gbDebug = False   '  change this to true to see lots of debug message boxes
'
' SURPRISES:
'  I have left some msgbox's and some redundant error trapping in some routines, this will be taken out real soon.
'  The are some extra definitions that I have left for the future.

' FUTURE:
' -------
' There is a lot of scope to improve this code.
'
'
' Key Compares.
' -----------
'  Use CompareKeys to check if keys are less, equal or more than each other.  This is because
'  there is a lexical member value.  This makes each key lexical compared, so it makes more
'  sense to human readability.  If you change the lexical to non-lexical you will get true
'  computer sorted keys and hence if you use this you will inherit the same comparisons.
'  If you don't and then later change it and you don't change to code outside the class
'  you will get data inconsistent results.
'
' DONT:  Try this with non-unique keys.  For example A,A,B,C,D,D,E,E
'--------------------------------------------------------------------
' If you do try adding the same key more than once, YOU WILL GENERATE an ERROR.
' This is deliberate.  About 10+ years ago, I wrote a procedure (in C) to allow duplicate
' keys in a Binary tree.  It took me ages to perfect, it was always needing updates/tweaks
' and many coding changes.  I know these days, I could add this quite easily but it's a
' lot more testing! So it has not been included in this release. When I have tested
' using duplicate keys in the same tree and it's reliable and allows correct nodal deletes,
' I will then remove the error trap, make it conditional based on global value and thus allow
' duplicate keys to be stored in the tree.  Of course those brave people reading this
' are welcome to take the class and try with duplicate keys, you don't have to wait for  =[8-)
